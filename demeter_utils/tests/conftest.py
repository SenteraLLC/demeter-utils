# How can we easily test row-level functions?

# Create `test_demeter` schema to test query functions.

# For each row-level function, test across different possibilities and to ensure we are catching possible
# typing errors.
# Add test data to `test_demeter` as needed.

# Test behavior for `add_feature()` for functions that create Series and those that create DataFrames
# I think we should standardize this result once we have the test data created.
